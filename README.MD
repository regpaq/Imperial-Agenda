# Imperial Agenda

Basic To-do app built with vanilla javascript using local storage. Design inspired by a galaxy far, far away...

[View demo](https://regpaq.github.io/Imperial-Agenda/)

## Features

- Tasks saved in local storage so they will remain when you refresh your browser
- Access keyboard shortcuts by typing ctrl + / keys
- Tasks are automatically organized by due date, earliest in time to latest
- Tasks that are red if is is overdue, light if due today, and dark if due in the future

## Known issues

This project was a study of working with basic JavaScript objects and arrays. It was also a learning experience for designing a UI and UX in Figma and building that design in code. It is a concept, not meant for actual use, and therefore not all use-cases (browsers, devices, accessibility) wered considered as they ought to be.

- Design for task inputs on mobile are not optimized very well
- Safari has issues working with dates and is not in a usable state
- Design and html structure not made with accessibility in mind
